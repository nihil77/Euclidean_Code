The do-while loop in the method performs these steps until the remainder rem is 0. Inside the loop, the quotient and remainder of dividing Number1 by Number2 are computed and stored in quotient and rem, respectively. The current step of the algorithm is also stored in a string computation for later display. If rem is not 0, Number1 is set to Number2 and Number2 is set to rem to repeat the process with the smaller number. If rem is 0, the loop exits and the GCD, which is the value of Number2, is returned.
